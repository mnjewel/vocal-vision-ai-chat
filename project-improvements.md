# Project Improvements

## 1. Refactored Large Components

We've broken down the large components into smaller, more focused components:

### ChatInterface.tsx Refactoring:
- Created `MessageInput.tsx` for handling message input and submission
- Created `MessageList.tsx` for displaying chat messages
- Created `ModelCapabilities.tsx` for showing model capabilities
- Created `ModelCapabilitiesBanner.tsx` for displaying model-specific banners
- Created `PersonaSelector.tsx` for persona selection functionality
- Created `ConversationActions.tsx` for conversation-related actions
- Created `ImagePreview.tsx` for displaying uploaded images
- Created `ApiKeyInput.tsx` for API key input form

This refactoring improves:
- Code readability and maintainability
- Component reusability
- Testing capabilities
- Performance through more focused re-renders

## 2. Enhanced Type Safety

We've improved TypeScript configuration for better type safety:

- Enabled `strict` mode in tsconfig files
- Enabled `noImplicitAny` to catch implicit any types
- Enabled `strictNullChecks` to prevent null/undefined errors
- Enabled `noUnusedLocals` and `noUnusedParameters` to catch unused code
- Added `forceConsistentCasingInFileNames` for cross-platform compatibility

These changes help catch errors at compile time rather than runtime.

## 3. Improved Error Handling

We've added a robust error handling system:

- Created `errorHandler.ts` utility with:
  - Custom error types for different error categories
  - Centralized error handling function
  - Safe async function wrapper
  - Error creation helpers

This provides:
- Consistent error handling across the application
- Better error messages for users
- Improved debugging capabilities

## 4. Database Schema Consistency

We've added schema validation for database operations:

- Created `schemaValidator.ts` with:
  - Zod schemas for database entities
  - Validation functions for database operations
  - Type definitions that match the database schema

Benefits:
- Ensures data consistency between application and database
- Catches schema errors before they reach the database
- Provides clear error messages for validation failures

## 5. Testing Infrastructure

We've set up a comprehensive testing infrastructure:

- Added Jest configuration
- Created test setup with mocks for:
  - Web APIs (SpeechRecognition, localStorage)
  - Supabase client
- Added a sample component test
- Added test scripts to package.json

This enables:
- Unit testing of components and utilities
- Integration testing of features
- Automated test running in CI/CD pipelines

## Next Steps

1. **Complete the Refactoring**:
   - Refactor `useChat.tsx` into smaller, focused hooks
   - Update imports to use the new refactored components

2. **Add More Tests**:
   - Write tests for all components
   - Add tests for hooks and utilities
   - Add integration tests for key features

3. **Implement Database Migrations**:
   - Add a migration system for database schema changes
   - Create initial migration for current schema

4. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Implement virtual scrolling for large conversations
   - Add memoization for expensive computations
   - Optimize re-renders with React.memo and useMemo

5. **Accessibility Improvements**:
   - Add ARIA attributes to components
   - Improve keyboard navigation
   - Enhance screen reader support
